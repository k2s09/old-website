Hi, I'm Kavin. Tech Enthusiast and Dank Memer. I'm a senior in High School in India in the STEM Field. I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. 

My interests are at the intersection of math, science, computer science, and information technology. I am drawn to STEM careers because I am organized, analytical, and goal-oriented. My academic achievements and expertise go hand-in-hand with my active participation in the Tech Cohort of our time. I am also responsible, goal-oriented, and very open-minded.

Fast forward to today, I am the co-founder and director of a National Tech Symposium, President of my School's Tech Club, and am part of the Student Council as the IT Captain of my School.

My current focus is working towards getting into a good college, following my passion for technology, and becoming a better person.

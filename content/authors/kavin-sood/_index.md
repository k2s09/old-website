bio: |
  Hey! I’m Kavin, the guy that runs this place. Tech Enthusiast and Dank Memer.

  I’m a senior in High School in India in the STEM Field. I enjoy creating things that live on the internet.

  My interests lie at the intersection of Math, Science, Computer Science and Information Technology. I’m attracted to STEM because of my organized, analytical and goal-oriented nature. In addition to my academic achievements, I am proud to actively contribute to the Tech Cohort of our time.

  Fast forward to today, and I've co-founded and directed a National Tech Symposium, founded and presided over my School's Tech Club, and become the IT Captain of my School.

  My main focus these days is working towards getting into a good college, pursuing my passion in the field of Tech, and becoming a better individual.

  By the way, I love playing basketball, football, swimming, listening to Dua Lipa and taking long walks at night.

My startup ideas

1. A local / international funky news app where all the news starts with "Bro did ______ ðŸ’€". It shows the world apart from political drama.
2. A hype based alarm clock app that has motivational videos like "Pancho Friday aaa" but for every day of the week

Jokes aside, it takes real brain power to come up with good business ideas, and Iâ€™ll be training the thinking muscle for a while before I think about running a business, and also, its probably not the best idea to share it publicly :D

_Simply described as a Tech Enthusiast._

I’m a senior (17M) in High School in India in the STEM Field. I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. 

My interests lie at the intersection of Math, Science, Computer Science and Information Technology. I’m attracted to STEM because of my organized, analytical and goal-oriented nature. In addition to my academic achievements, I am proud to actively contribute to the Tech Cohort of our time.

Fast forward to today, and I've founded and directed a Nationwide Tech Symposium, Presided over my School's Tech Club, and become the Information Technology Captain of my School.

My main focus these days is working towards getting into a good college, pursuing my passion in the field of Tech, and becoming a better individual.

By the way, I love playing basketball, football, swimming, listening to Spanish music.

I write because it's a passion and being able to create content is a nice and very useful skill! 

*Why do I call myself the 'Chadmin'?*
I am humoring myself. Chadmin is the conjunctive formed by 'Gigachad' and 'Admin'. Please further connect the dots.

I call myself the 'chadmin' of this blog because I am the one who manages this blog. I am the one who writes the blog posts, manages the comments, and does all the other stuff. 

I also manage my own website, which is the home of this blog. I built it using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It's a static site, which means that it's fast and secure. It's also easy to make changes to.

I hope you enjoy this blog. Thanks for stopping by!

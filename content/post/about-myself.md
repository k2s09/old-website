Are you ready to dive into the world of tech? Meet Kavin, a senior (17M) in High School from India, who lives and breathes all things STEM. As a self-proclaimed Tech Enthusiast and the mastermind behind this blog, Kavin is passionate about creating things that live on the internet.

With a keen interest in the intersection of Math, Science, Computer Science, and Information Technology, Kavin's analytical and goal-oriented nature make him a force to be reckoned with. When he's not presiding over his school's Tech Club or organizing a nationwide Tech Symposium, you can find him working out, playing basketball or running to stay sharp and clear his mind.

In addition to his love for all things tech, Kavin is also a big fan of music, with a particular soft spot for UK Drill, Spanish Music, Dream-phonk, and especially Dua Lipa. He's also a cat person.

Kavin's ultimate goal is to pursue his passion for technology and become a better individual. He believes in using his platform to actively contribute to the tech community and inspire others to do the same. That's why he's built and managed his own website using Hugo and Netlify. As the 'Chadmin' of this blog, he's the one who manages the comments, writes the blog posts, and does all the other stuff to keep things running smoothly.

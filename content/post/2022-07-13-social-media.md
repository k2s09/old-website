This is a reminder and wake up call to use social media and relish it’s benefits and, stop worrying too much about the negatives.  

To be clear, I know very well that applies to me because I am well into the privacy rabbit hole and, sometimes, it’s nice to take a step back. After two years into the 20s, I *want* more social interaction.  

In these times, there is no online digital privacy.  

So there is a need to normalise more social interactions in general. I want to experience more communication and feel good coming back, *better* than before, after the pandemic.  

As a moment of self reflection, I feel like I need to participate in the quo more. At times I feel like I am missing out. And that is not necessarily a bad thing.  

I believe that this will be helpful for my fellow young people in a similar place.  

A list of the Social Media Platforms I use, Why and the reforms I would like to take:  

1. YouTube → I use this as a main source of videos and content in general. My biggest interests on the platform are Tech Videos, Music, Movies recommendations and clips, Educational Content on Science with the occasional Gaming. *More liking, disliking, saving posts and commenting.  
2. Twitter → I use Twitter for just reading tweets of my favorite figures - celebrities, friends, popular, smart and all types of wonderful people. I would like to continue my same account, just like to make a nice profile and perhaps comment occasionally.  
3. Reddit → I don’t want to lose my account with plenty karma to do whatever I want. I realise that I use reddit a lot and want to start over, but with the same account, commenting, making posts and interacting. Essentially I just don’t want to be a ghost.  
4. Discord - It is a wonderful platform for interacting with people online. My account is already pretty good. I would like to clean my servers and join some educational and useful ones. Also, perhaps look into making bots.  
5. Instagram → It is the biggest platform for interacting with known people in my school and otherwise around me in some way. Add a few meme pages and big accounts and it seems perfect. I would like to post every once a while and interact with people on Instagram, though I’d still like to keep my distance from the Facebook-ness of it all.  
6. Facebook - No.   
7. Pinterest - Lmao No.  
8. Snapchat - I am doing fine with snapchat. Created a BitMoji which was very fun and added some people. I’d like to use it for DMs if required. Don’t have a further usecase.  
9. Quora - My account’s saved posts and comments, and recommendations are a goldmine of good and inspiring content. I’d like to continue reading such interesting and motivational pieces by aspiring writers every once a while.  
10. LinkedIn - For another time, but this is useful for me too. Make a better profile is all.   
11. Twitch - Sometimes see livestreams? I’m not a huge fan.  
12. Medium - Read and write articles! [Here is my page!](https://medium.com/@kavinsood)  

In general, I want to increase my interactivity on platforms, be it liking, commenting or posting myself. This falls in line with my general reduction in consumerism but increase in two-sided communication.

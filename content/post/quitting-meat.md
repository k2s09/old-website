In this opinion piece, I debate the antics about quitting meat.

•	It is harder for the body to digest meat. Having eaten plant food for so long has adapted my stomach and intestines to light foods. The food metabolizes and breaks down with ease and I remain light during the day. When you aren't a frequent meat eater, meat makes you feel sluggish.

•	Ethics and Morals - Factory farming is horrible. Killing animals with superior intellect, arguably higher conscience and understanding of complex emotions like Cows and Squid is arguably bad and makes one feels guilty because that is ‘murder’, but the simple idea of killing animals for food isn’t, because that is the intended path for survival by nature.

•	Mass production of meat is bad for the environment. If land used for rearing is put towards better purposes like crop production, way more people can be fed and less water is used. The greenhouse gas output like Methane of animals is 100x that of plants, as a source of food.

At the top of a food web, there is the Sun connected to Plants, to Herbivores and Carnivores. The higher-up your source of food in this chain, the more resource efficient it is. A civilization of higher intelligence and understanding of their role in harbouring life in the universe would be eating more plants. Due to the upcoming plight of the climate catastrophe, humanity have to look for ways of cutting their carbon emissions. To cut 25% of total global carbon emissions, we could either cut all fuel-based travel like Airplanes, Cars and Trains or stop eating Cow, Pig and Goat. Shockingly, both these choices (All carbon-emitting vehicles and in the world V.S. Cows, Pigs, and Goats as food) pollute a similar amount of Carbon Dioxide and Methane. The decision is clear, certain things just can’t be taken down as they are inadmissible to the growth of our species. It would be like returning to the Middle Ages.

•	Being vegan does not give you an adequate balanced and nutritious diet, especially for a fairly active lifestyle. Vitamin B12, D3, Calcium, and Omega 3 are lacking in a purely vegan diet.

•	When debating whether a vegan diet is really practical on a broad scale, one of the places we may want to look at is human history.  Can we find ancient vegan tribes or even whole vegetarian civilizations in history? And if so, how did those experiments go? The truth is that there is no evidence of completely vegan cultures in known human history. The philosophy behind eating meat can be traced back to early human civilizations as they used to hunt animals for food. Even today, meat consumption is still an integral part of many cultures around the world. The Harappans living in the Indo-Gangetic Plains in 2000 BCE, said to be the ancestors of modern Aryans, practiced Early-Vedic Religion. Reports indicated that they were fond of eating meat, especially beef, and lamb. There are reports that vegetarian movements were a recurring theme in Ancient Greece and Japan. India gave the world Buddhism and Jainism, which would go on to influence vegan diets in the rest of Asia as well as Europe.

So, I will not be a regular meat eater. That is for sure. But I do plan to continue eating meat occasionally. I would certainly be more thoughtful and careful with my choice of place serving meat as health is the only real concern for me, like preventing acne outbreaks, digestion problems and plant-based nutrition for better health. Otherwise, I live a relatively environmentally healthy life and I need not guilt-trip myself.

Apart from philosophical reasons for quitting meat, Vegans are essentially vegetarians with celiac disease or lactose intolerance or both. Simply because a complete nutritious diet cannot be achieved with just fruits and vegetables.

When it comes to the environmental impact of eating meat, it is important to note that apart from cow and pig meat, other meat products produce minimal dairy as compared to other sources of greenhouse emissions. For instance, the International Livestock Research Institute estimates that livestock accounts for only 14.5% of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. This means that other sources of emissions such as transportation, energy production, and industrial processes, are responsible for the majority of global warming. 

Therefore, reducing meat consumption may not be as effective in curbing global warming as cutting down on emissions from other sources. Moreover, as meat is an important part of many cultures and diets, it can be difficult to get people to cut back on their consumption. 

Nevertheless, there are still ways to reduce meat consumption in today’s world. People can start by eating less red meat and replacing it with other sources of protein such as fish, nuts, and legumes. People can also choose to eat organic and free-range meats, which are typically produced in a more sustainable manner. Finally, individuals can also opt for a vegetarian or vegan diet, which has been shown to have significant environmental benefits.

As my biggest life philosophy, I believe in The Path of Moderation. Truly.

It is the chain of thought that I most wholeheartedly concur with, and it has become a way of life for me.

It is simple enough, but I like to use it in everything. Modern radical and extremist views might steer your mind to believe that being moderate is worse off than taking a side. Whether that is true or not is not something I can deduce. But join me as we blissfully exist in the universe.

Also, this will be an ever-ongoing essay. I will continue to expand this topic in moods of heightened sensitivity, ponderings, reveries and philosophy.

1. Being moderate makes you friendly and relatable with a wider group of people in the world. You become a people's person, helping fulfilling the lives of not only yourself, but of the ones around you and spreading positivity. Let's face it, we all could help a dose of happiness and positivity.

2. Being moderate makes you *kind*. Kind to your own body and mind.

3. You don't break relations with people over your thoughts and opinions. Being moderate, you learn to co-exist with others in your community.

4. In the end, there is nothing is bigger than life. Being simple and humble comes with being moderate. Nothing matters.

5. Being moderate also helps you be rational by not making irrational decisions.

6. The world does not reward doing the right thing. Nature is a wild game, played by animals. *"When you play all sides, you come out on top."* The phrase "when you play all sides, you come out on top" suggests that by being neutral or non-committal, one can avoid conflicts and emerge victorious. This is because by not aligning oneself with any particular group or ideology, one is able to avoid the pitfalls and drawbacks that come with taking a stance on a particular issue. In some cases, this approach may allow a person to gain advantages or benefits from multiple parties. However, it should be noted that this approach may also lead to a lack of commitment or loyalty to any particular cause or principle, which could be seen as a negative trait. This is also the mentality of CEOs, the bosses of corporations, who work only towards their business gains. This shows that _even hyper-successful people_ follow moderation.

7. Humans follow the path of least resistance. One who doesn't go with the flow of the water doesn't understand the size of the river. We are a small speck in the universe and don't control the universe. It should keep us aware of our mortality and remain on the path of moderation, flowing along.

8. The path of moderation also covets simplicity. Sometimes it's worth not being an academic, over-analysing things to the point of sucking out all the fun. Our survival and innate instincts are simple and moderate. They aim to achieve maximum survival. We should aim follow the same. 

9. People might believe being moderate makes you very innocent, virgin and naive, but when you think about it, making your every moderation can make you a remarkably good manipulator. Take it as you will.

10. Being moderate gives you no weaknesses.

* Humans are creatures of habit. We get in cycles of repetition, and that is life as well, a cycle. A way for self-reflection and introspection, to find out whether we are in a wrong and vicious cycle, is to take a broader view, look big picture. 
* Secondly, I would like to bring up the idea of the butterfly effect. The butterfly effect rests on the notion that the world is deeply interconnected, such that one small occurrence can influence a much larger complex system. Now, just take yourself as a system. Each of your life's occurences and experiences are heavily bound on your actions, however small they may be.
* Now, hear me out. If you could take a bird's eye view of your life, taking into account all of your actions, you would see that every path of life has some ups and downs. However fundamental may be the pushing force for a human - compassion, greatness, knowledge, etc., every *clear* direction that one can take has its consequences.
* Also, taking a stance towards any opinion or adopting a stereotype to define onself has its own ups and downs.
* Understanding our impermanence on this world, there is no way to tell the best way for yourself without having lived them all. 
* It is a common belief that understanding our own impermanence can help us to appreciate the value of life and to live it to the fullest. This is because knowing that our time on this earth is limited can help us to prioritize our actions and to make the most of the opportunities that come our way. However, it is impossible for any one person to have lived every possible path in life, and therefore it is impossible to say for certain which path is the "best" for any individual.
* The best path of life is ultimately a matter of personal preference and will vary from person to person. What may be the perfect path for one person may not be the right fit for another. This is because each individual has their own unique set of values, goals, and priorities, and what is important to one person may not be as important to another.
* In the end, the best path of life is the one that brings the most fulfillment and happiness to the individual. This may involve pursuing a career that is personally meaningful, forming strong relationships with others, or engaging in activities that bring a sense of satisfaction and joy. Ultimately, the key is to make the most of the time we have and to live our lives in a way that feels authentic and true to ourselves.
* Thus logically speaking, the moderate path is the best, leaving you the strongest in the end. 
* In clear words, Let nothing define you, because everything is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
* A simple example is being an introvert or an extrovert. Simply accept neither as defining you. Then you internalise what that means for you and enjoy the benefits of both sides ☺️. Mentally, this can be a very strong and liberating exercise.

I believe this philosophy sits well in the popular beliefs of stoicism. Thus, following such a path in life would be honorable and meaningful. I also believe that these traits are the hallmark of a strong individual, and would love to meet people sharing similar beliefs, or showing a passion in this stream of philosophy.

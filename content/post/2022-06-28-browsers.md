With the growth of the internet and rise of web apps, the browser has become the most used application on any computer.

Modern web browsers are bridging the gap between operating systems thanks to their incredible cross-platform capabilities. For instance, I have less problems using MacOS or Linux since I would mostly use Chrome.

Your work will greatly benefit from knowing and using the right tool for the job. Therefore let‚Äôs consider the various browsers on the market and pick the right one for the job, which is browsing the web.

Contenders: Chrome, Edge, Brave, Firefox, Safari, Vivaldi, Opera GX.

Before the in-depth comparison, we need to emphasize one point. Even though it would slowly be clear that no browser is perfect, every modern browser is suitably capable of doing their one job. Uniqueness is getting scarce.

## Chrome
*Ah, the most used browser in existence on every platform by a longshot.*

Pros:
* So, it just works. No, really. Every web developer optimises their sites for Chrome first.
* It‚Äôs really fast. Google has gifted the world with Chromium, which is now the most used browser backend engine. Chromium uses Blink and V8 - JavaScript and WebAssembly Engines, implementations of HTTPS and internal caching system. Chromium is also cross-platform. So, Chrome is pretty dang fast, and allows every other browser to also use its engine to be pretty fast for a coherent internet, which we can all respect.
* Sync is the best. Chrome has the best implementation of Account Browser Sync I have seen on a browser, and believe me, I have seen them all. It makes you feel right at home, very quickly and efficiently. Also, this feature seems to the best most buggy amongst browsers, even today, and is flawlessly smooth with Chrome.
Cons:
* Privacy Issues. Google is not a Tech Company, it is an advertising company. It is a data hemorrhage. While they do not sell data outside their organisation, Google having a lot of information about you isn‚Äôt great anyways. 
* Adblock extensions suffer on PC. They might even die out as a result of Manifest V3.
* On Mobile, I would rate Chrome pretty low in account of actual usage. If you come across scummy articles and web pages, Chrome does nothing to help you.

## Edge
*The truly better browser on Windows.*

Pros:
* Fantastic appearance. Everything about Edge when dialled in right looks great. The mica colors, address bar, wallpapers and videos and vertical tabs, everything is just *elegant*.
* This transitions great into the next point. Microsoft allows us to do this with their actual *better* settings and options. Collections, Math Solver, Shopping Assistant, Efficiency Mode and Immersive Reader are all great features to have. Even about, Security and Privacy, there are a lot of unique things about Edge. I appreciate the true innovation coming from a company like Microsoft.
* Faster than regular Chromium browsers including Chrome. Edge uses fewer resources, especially memory.
* It took a few updates, but Microsoft Edge has largely caught up with Chrome. While Chrome can sync themes and addresses and phone number information and Edge cannot, Microsoft‚Äôs browser otherwise matches Google‚Äôs syncing capabilities.
* Edge works really well with Microsoft‚Äôs own work services like OneDrive and Office. It is a matter of preference of services.
Cons:
* While true innovation and heated competition brings in users and customers like me, not everyone enters Microsoft‚Äôs ecosystem this way. The vast majority start using Edge because it is bundled with Windows and how hard Microsoft is playing to keep people using Edge. They are simply too aggressive in their tactics on keeping people on their platform. I do not appreciate the reminders periodically when I open Edge with a window which can‚Äôt be closed by pressing escape or clicking anywhere else, telling me to switch to Bing and use 'Microsoft‚Äôs Recommended Settings'. This does sway away some power users.

## Brave
*The convenient privacy oriented browser.*

Initially, I was of the opinion that Brave is a browser for lazy people who either don‚Äôt know or can‚Äôt be bothered to install an Adblocker on their browser. I was right, but in 2016. Now, Brave has become somewhat of a beast. 

Pros:
* Most polished stripped-down iteration of Chrome. Chromium in itself is a raw project. Un-googled Chrome is not a reliable project either.
* Great Ad-block with CNAME Blocking and Manifest V2 on latest Chromium.
* Brave works hard to oppose decisions by the top browsers that harm privacy. Its has strong AdBlock, Fingerprinting Protection, Script Blocking, and blocks third party cookies out of the box. Defaults do matter and Brave has it all sorted out. It supports features like AMP Page Redirection, TOR and IFPS
* Brave‚Äôs mobile version absolutely annihilates every other browser. Chrome on Mobile is dead to me. If you find yourself visiting rather scummy websites on mobile, Brave is the best tool you can use. It sterilises the browsing experience greatly on mobile, where screen real estate is dire and crucial.
Cons:
- Too much Crypto Stuff. Yes, Blockchain is cool, but I don‚Äôt want it anywhere near my browser. I don‚Äôt want to invest in crypto or dig deeper than I already know on the subject. The crypto features are a gimmick to me.
- I do not fancy the revenue model of Brave. I will not use BAT. Just another annoyance for me to remove every time I am setting up the browser. When visiting community support forums, BAT has by far the most issues. It‚Äôs good that the Brave team is starting to use other sources of revenue because I find the adblocking a crucial feature of Brave and will not see ads.
## Firefox
*The Monk, Lone Wolf and King.*
Firefox has been the true and oldest browser fighting for moral causes on the internet.
With that said, a part of the OG diehard Firefox users don‚Äôt like the ‚ÄòProton‚Äô design changes.
## Safari
*The dying monopolistic browser.*

By majority opinion by the web developer community, Safari is become the old Internet Explorer. Apple‚Äôs extremely locked down approach to browser engines bites them in the back.

Having to use WebKit as the only browser engine on all platforms is one of the worst and most locked down decisions Apple has made.

## Opera GX
_The surprisingly usable browser made for gamers._

It is no surprise that the gaming industry is at the bloody top of the entertainment industry in terms of revenue. Opera GX is a surprisingly practical rendition of that business opportunity.

Do not underestimate it, it is no stupid skin on Opera. It does have very useful features, but I must say, it‚Äôs appearance customisation options are comically ridiculous but unironically great.

Truly unique features include: Dark Mode Flag without reload, Auto PIP button on Chromium, free VPN, and of course, resource limiters.

I find a lot of the gaming features as not pertaining to my user case. The main problem is with Opera‚Äôs parent company. The company was acquired by a Chinese-based investor group in 2018 prior to its IPO and things have taken a turn for the worse since then. The company‚Äôs browser gross margins collapsed by 22.6% in just one year. It uncovered that Opera‚Äôs CEO ‚Äúwas recently involved in a Chinese lending business‚Äù and that Opera has started to make a ‚Äúsimilar and dramatic pivot into predatory short-term loans in Africa and India‚Äù. According to Hindenburg, Opera generates ‚Äúover 42% of the company‚Äôs revenue‚Äù from its short-term loan business.

## Vivaldi
_The opinionated and feature dense browser._

Out of laziness and mostly‚Ä¶ laziness, I will not be covering this browser.

It‚Äôs just not my jam, bro. A bit too much work to use and cover here üò©

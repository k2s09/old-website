Fast charging is a revolutionary invention that has changed the world. It has changed the way people use their devices.

# Phones
The premise is simple, charging, but faster, without blowing up your phone.

A few years ago, your average smartphone would typically come with a 5W charging cable, which would usually charge your phone from 0 percent to 100 percent in about two or two and a half hours. Today, 40-65W fast charging is available on most smartphones, and some even support 80W. The OnePlus 10R & the Realme GT Neo 3 150W edition support 150W charging, which can fully recharge a 5000mAh battery in nearly 17 minutes. Now that’s impressive. So how does it happen without blowing up your phone?

**Not all phones are created equal.**

Now, different manufacturers use different fast-charging protocols. Apple and Google phones use USB-PD, whereas most Android phones use the latest Qualcomm standard or, as with Realme and OnePlus, their proprietary charging protocols. Most of these protocols function similarly. The difference arises in the power allowed to pass between the charging brick and the device itself. A controller chip is used to perform this function. The ports on the device are calibrated to operate only with a specific type of charger to reach their maximum capacity. A certain fast charger from OnePlus, for example, might not work on a Samsung phone.

**A touch of chemistry**

In any given battery, there is a positive terminal and a negatively charged terminal. Most phones use a lithium-ion or a lithium polymer battery. When a battery is powering a device, the lithium ions flow from the negative side to the positive side, through a liquid electrolyte solution. This flow is what powers the device. When there are insufficient lithium ions on the negative side, i.e. the flow becomes weak or stops altogether, the battery runs out of charge.

Charging the battery again makes the ions flow from the positive side, back to the negative side, again, through the liquid electrolyte solution. The wattage of the charger, and the charging protocols, determine the speed with which this flow takes place. The higher the wattage, the faster the flow of the ions at the peak.

**Dealing with heat**
During the charging process, it is this electrolyte solution that heats up. Sometimes, this heating up of the solution may even cause the battery to explode, especially if it isn’t managed properly. That is why you will see that as a battery starts reaching its maximum storage while charging, say, 75 percent or so, the charging speed slows down. This is done to reduce the heat output, and extend the battery’s life. Another thing that causes the battery to heat up, is that after a certain number of charging cycles, these ions lose their capacity to hold a positive charge. This means they cannot flow through the solution. This is why, after a few months or years of usage, the capacity of the battery also dips. The more “dead” ions in a battery, the quicker it heats up. This also leads to batteries expanding. Basically, with fast charging, the wear and tear on a device's battery are significantly higher.

**Expanding batteries**
Now, the cells inside a lithium-ion battery will expand a small amount when it is being charged. This is because of the heat and is a completely normal process. It returns to its original form when the electrolyte solution cools down, provided it is not loaded with dead ions. To counter this and to give devices and their batteries a longer life, manufacturers have now started using split batteries. Instead of one huge battery with a capacity of, say, 5000mAh, some manufacturers are using two batteries of 2500mAh each.

Fast charging is a double-edged sword for most manufacturers and users. That is the reason why, most of the research and development around batteries now, is around managing the time taken to charge and ways to optimize battery health. With 240W fast charging on its way, it will be interesting to see how manufacturers improve ways to make batteries last longer, and how to maximize battery health.

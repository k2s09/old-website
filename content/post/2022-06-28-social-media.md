This is a personal reminder and wake up call for me to use social media and relish it’s benefits and, stop worrying too much about the negatives.

To be clear, this applies to me because I am well into the privacy rabbit hole and, sometimes, it’s nice to take a step back.

In these times, there is no online digital privacy.

So I need to normalise more social interactions in general. I want to experience more communication and feel good coming back, *better* than before, after the pandemic.

As a moment of self reflection, I feel like I need to participate in the quo more. At times I feel like I am missing out. And that is not necessarily a bad thing.

A list of the Social Media Platforms I use, Why and the reforms I would like to take:

1. YouTube → I use this as a main source of videos and content in general. My biggest interests on the platform are Tech Videos, Music, Movies recommendations and clips, Educational Content on Science with the occasional Gaming. *More liking, disliking, saving posts and commenting. Maintain my precious personal gmail account which I have been using for about 7 years.*
2. Twitter → I use Twitter for just reading tweets of my favorite figures. I would like to continue my same account, just like to make a nice profile and perhaps comment occasionally.
3. Reddit - I don’t want to lose my account with plenty karma to do whatever I want. I realise that I use reddit a lot and want to start over, but with the same account, commenting, making posts and interacting. AAA I just don’t want to be a ghost.
4. Discord - It is a wonderful platform for interacting with people online. My account is already pretty good. I would like to clean my servers and join some educational and useful ones. Also, perhaps look into making bots.
5. Instagram - Oh man, my Instagram account is screwed. Find a way to delete previous and start over. Editing this later, good news! My new instagram account is in full swing and I’m working on it. I have already starting taking more pictures with my new phone’s camera and I would like to post every once a while and interact with people on Instagram, though I’d still like to keep my distance from the Facebook-ness of it all.
6. Facebook - No. 
7. Snapchat - I am doing fine with snapchat. Just use it for DMs if required.
8. Pinterest - Lmao No.
9. Quora - Update profile and change about. Otherwise my account’s saved and recommendations are a goldmine of good content.
10. LinkedIn - For another time, but this is useful for me too. Make a better profile is all.
11. Twitch - Sometimes see livestreams? I’m not a huge fan.
12. Medium - Read and write articles!

In general, I want to increase my interactivity on platforms, be it liking, commenting or posting myself. This falls in line with my general reduction in consumerism.

In this article, I debate the antics of quitting meat. In the end, I do not.

* Meat screws up the digestive process. Being used to eating plant food has adapted my stomach and intestines to be used to the light food. It is processed and broken down easily and I remain light in the day. As a non frequent meat eater, meat makes you sluggish throughout the day.
* Ethics and Morals - Factory farming is horrible. Killing conscious animals with superior intellect and understanding of complex emotions like Cows and Squid is arguably bad, but the simple idea of killing animals for food isn’t.
* For the environment, meat is bad. The land could be used for better purposes, enormous amounts of water is used up and tons of greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere. The methane output from meat rearing is 100x that of plants, as a source of food. Simply put, the higher up your source of food in the food chain, the more resource efficient. A civilisation of higher intelligence and understanding of their role in harboring life in the universe would be eating more plants. If today humanity had to make a choice to cut 25% of their carbon emissions, fuel based travel like Airplanes wouldn’t be taken down, as that is inadmissible to the growth of our species. It would be like returning to the middle ages. Rather, cows and pigs would be cut from diets and thus not farmed. It is shocking that both these choices (All carbon emitting vehicles and in the world V.S. Cows, Pigs and Goats as food) pollute a similar amount of Carbon Dioxide and Methane. The decision is clear.

With that said,

* Being vegan does not give you an adequate balanced and nutritious diet, especially for a fairly active lifestyle. Vitamin B12, D3, Calcium and Omega 3 are lacking in a pure vegan diet.
* When debating whether a vegan diet is really _practical_ on a broad scale, one of the places we may want to look is human history. Can we find ancient vegan tribes or even whole vegetarian civilizations in history? And if so, how did those experiments go? The truth is that there is no evidence of completely vegan cultures in known human history. The Harappans living in the Indo-Gangetic Plains 2000 BCE, said to be the ancestors of modern Aryans, practised Early-Vedic Religion. Reports indicated that they were fond of eating meat, especially beef and lamb. There are some estimates that people from Greece and Japan used to be vegetarians, but that must have been a small set of people, since I groups of people from those era can easily be pinpointed to be meat eaters - Spartans and Samurais. One civilisation that have strong evidence of being vegans are the Jains, but there are enough difference in philosophy between mine and that of strict Jains that I don’t find any purpose basing my decision on theirs.

So, I will not be a regular meat eater. That is for sure. But, I do plan to continue eating meat occasionally. I would certainly be more thoughtful and careful with my choice of place serving meat as health is the only true issue for me. Otherwise, I live a relatively environmentally healthy life and I personally need not guilt-trip myself.

Another one of my conclusions is that vegans are essentially vegetarians with celiac disease or lactose intolerance, or both. Simply due to the fact that a complete nutritious diet cannot be achieved with just fruits and vegetables.

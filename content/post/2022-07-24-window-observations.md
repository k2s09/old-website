With the age of window layouts and tiling window managers, is manually resizing windows in an old school way practical?

A benefit for 16:10 is because it more *closely* aligns with the golden aspect ratio (**Φ = 1.1618..)** as compared to 16:9 (1.677..)

I also find myself resizing windows consciously but vaguely to sizes resembling the golden number ratio. The windows just look better. Being subjected to window screenshots on websites for a long time, they must have been profiled to Φ for aesthetic purposes, which I have picked up, and it is probably for the better. 

A rather fun thing I noticed was that I am always accurate to the second decimal place when comparing my window’s aspect ratio to that of the golden number, which is not bad at all :)

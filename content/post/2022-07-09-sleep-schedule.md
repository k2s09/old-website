Sleep is magical. Humans spend a third of their lives sleeping, on average. In this era, media and entertainment has **exploded**. Amongst younger folk, sleep ainâ€™t cool. 

We have to collectively chill down with that notion.

I need to fix my goddamn sleep schedule. Itâ€™s better to sleep two hours more in the night if that gives you a more productive rest-of-the-day.

First of all, if you ever want to try out a new schedule, you need to sleep in that pattern for at least a week to observe any changes.

**Fortunately,** I have been sleeping in a horrible way for quite some time now, so I don't need to experiment more with it.

For the next week, I want to genuinely set a challenge for myself. I want to sleep for 9+ hours *every single day of the week*.

It starts today, the 25th of June.

Saturday: 7 hours 30 minutes
Sunday: 5 hours 15 minutes
Monday: 6 hours
Tuesday: 5 hours
Wednesday: 3 hours 30 minutes
Thursday: 10 hours 30 minutes
Friday: 4 hours 30 minutes

*In the last week of June, I have got 6 hours of sleep a night on average. Now, I will experiment having two more REM cycles with 9 hours every day.*

Saturday: 9 hours 15 minutes
Sunday: 7 hours
Monday: 8 hours 30 minutes
Tuesday: 8 hours
Wednesday: 7 hours 45 minutes
Thursday: 8 hours
Friday: 8 hours 15 minutes
Saturday: 9 hours

It is realised that 9 hours on a school week is humanely not possible. Lets try getting over 8. That is the goal.

Saturday Morning it will be evaluated again. It's inconvenient to try this out during school week but if the schedule is not sustainable during normal school days, it's never going to be sustainable.

Update: Wellll. 9 hours was a stretch. That was clear on Tuesday ðŸ˜‚.  The goal is more than 8 hours split in 2 times. I could go further and talk about brain waves emitted after sleep and the psychological effects of sleeping less but I believe I have this entire sleep thing figured out now.

Normalise having a healthy sleeping schedule ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

As my biggest life philosophy, I believe in The Path of Moderation. Truly.

It is the chain of thought that I most wholeheartedly concur with, and it has become a way of life for me.

It is simple enough, but I like to use it in everything. Modern radical and extremist views might steer your mind to believe that being moderate is worse off than taking a side. Whether that is true or not is not something I can deduce. But, join me as we blissfully exist in the universe in our divine journey.

Also, this will be an ever-ongoing essay. I will continue to expand this topic in moods of heightened sensitivity, ponderings, reveries and philosophy.

* Being moderate makes you friendly and relatable with a wider group of people in the world. You become a people's person, helping fulfilling the lives of not only yourself, but of the ones around you and spreading positivity. Let's face it, we all could help a dose of happiness and positivity. 
* Being moderate makes you *kind*. Kind to your own body and mind.
* You don't break relations with people over your thoughts and opinions. Being moderate, you learn to co-exist with others in your community
* Being moderate gives you no weaknesses. You do not accept stereotypes on either side of the spectrum, thus being the strongest there is, in the end. A simple example is being an introvert or an extrovert. Simply accept neither as defining you. Then you internalise what that means for you and enjoy the benefits of both sides ☺️.
* In the end, there is nothing is bigger than life. Being simple and humble comes with being moderate. Nothing matters.
* Being moderate also helps you be rational by not making irrational decisions.
* The world does not reward doing the right thing. Nature is a wild game, played by animals. *"When you play all sides, you come out on top."* This is also the mentality of CEOs, the bosses of corporations, who work only towards their business gains. This shows that even hyper-successful people follow moderation.

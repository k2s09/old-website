As my biggest life philosophy, I believe in the Path of Moderation. Truly. 

A way of living life for me. It is the path of moderation.

It is simple enough, but I like to use it in just about everything. Modern radical, extremist views might steer your mind to believe that being moderate is worse off than taking a side. Whether that is true is not something I can deduce. But join me as we blissfully live in the universe in this divine journey.

Also, this will be an ever-ongoing article. I will continue to expand this topic in moods of heightened sensitivity, ponderings, reveries and philosophies.

* *Being moderate makes you friendly and relatable with a wider group of people in the world.*
* *Being moderate gives you no weaknesses. You do not accept stereotypes on either side of the spectrum, thus being the strongest there is, in the end.*
* *In the end, there is nothing is bigger than life. Being simple and humble comes with being moderate. Nothing matters.*
* *The world does not reward doing the right thing. Nature is a wild game, played by animals. When you play all sides, you come out on top.*

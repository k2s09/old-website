## Books to Read!

Everyone knows that knowledge is power.

Few people know how much knowledge you can gain solely from books.

That's right — *solely* from books. The truth is you don’t have to buy dozens of expensive courses or sit in boring lectures in order to educate yourself.

Personally, I’ve learned far more things from books than I did from the lectures I attended in university or the online courses I’ve bought throughout the years — which brings me to the following list of books.

Each of the following books was educating, enlightening, and all broadened my knowledge on a range of topics and fields without me having to spend thousands of dollars on monotonous webinars and boring instructors.

Without further ado, let’s dive right in.

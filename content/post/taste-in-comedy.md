We are born and destined for greatness. We try and make meaning of our lives before it all ends, but most of life isn’t spent in a climax, it’s spent living.

Comedy and laughter is what we *live* for. I believe that one’s taste in comedy isn’t a reflection of their class or culture, it isn’t a reflection of anything. It’s just what they prefer to look at to cheer up and have a good time. 

First of all, I do consider myself as a Man of Culture, a Dank Memer, a Meme Lord in the land of the Internet-tia, but I must admit that while glancing at memes, the most I can get out of myself is a chuckle, or an exhale of the nostril and very occasionally a big laugh. It is because the effectiveness of image / gif based short-form content is exhaustive. One generates a sort of tolerance to such media, and the intensity of the media must be raised periodically for a constant output of laughs. So the truth is that classic comedy still trumps memes in making anyone laugh.

One big observation I have made is that people of your home country seem way funnier than others. For me, Indians will always be amongst the funniest I know. After all, the joy of jokes and insults is best in one’s mother tongue. Also I don’t just mean Indian comedians, I could walk into any group of people and find an absolutely hilarious dude or gal.

Apart from that, I believe that my African and South American brothers and sisters are the next funniest, like Nigerians, Mexicans, Brazillians, etc. My observation is that comedians from these demographics have the highest chance of having a show leaving the audience laughing so hard that they get stomach pain.

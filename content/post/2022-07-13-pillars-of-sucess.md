# An ode to success.

Success requires perseverance and adaptability. It requires fortitude and resilience in the plight of adversity.

Self-discipline, without a doubt, leads to triumph. You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.

Our greatest victory is not in never falling, but rising every time we fall. Emotional and physiological regulation, your thinking style, and your search for
ultimate meaning and purpose in life makes up for your resilience.

Perseverance, adaptability, resilience, blah blah blah.....Boohoohoo! All of that is crap. What you need are real answers, not posh wordplay. Let me decode the pillars of success in crisp and simple words.

# How to Succeed in life, explained.

First of all, you might ask why I am qualified to talk about this. Do you think someone has to be successful in everything in life after they step out of the womb? As the old saying goes, you don't have to be a baker to tell if a cake tastes like shit.

Now shut up and listen up, you stupid lizard brain.

To succeed in anything, you need to nail down two things - External factors and internal factors.

1. External Factors - There are things in life that come from within. This is not it. External factors are the ways that the evil world lays its influence on your life. You can definitely do things about it though.

    1. Food → Your body needs proper nutrition to do its best work. Start hydrating yourself properly and eat healthy food! Your physical health is directly tied to your mental and emotional health, and you do have one body.

    2. Sleep → For the majority of people, sleeping any less than 6 hours a night is destructive. If do you so continuously, you will fail. Lacking sleep isn’t cool, only do it temporarily. Get those sleep cycles!

    3. Affection → Alright, we are social beings. We need interaction, love and affection. What to remember is that all of it doesn’t have to come from humans, but for the part that does, surrounding yourself with nice people helps.

2. Internal Factors - These are the factors that come from within - about how your mind and soul is. These are not as directly impacted by the world because once you are in your late teens and adulthood, the degree of impact that anyone can have on your mind is really up to you. That complete sense of control over your mind is the biggest source of motivation for many things in life.

    1. Passion → Do you really want to do what you are doing? Do you like it? Does it give you happiness, contentment? Do you want to get up everyday and get to work?

    2. Vision → A vision is a manifestation, a mental image you create for yourself in the future. If you can really get behind a motive and see yourself in the future in a better position and, with a plan, then you have a vision.

    3. Dedication → Be determined, show resilience, put in the work and trust the process.

We humans are really simple beings. A lack of success in anything in your life can be explained to be caused by one of these factors. Self reflect and identify the issue and work towards fixing it. Anything can be accomplished in your life. Godspeed!

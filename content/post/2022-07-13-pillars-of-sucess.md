# An ode to success.

Success requires perseverance and adaptability. It requires fortitude and resilience in the plight of adversity.

Self-discipline, without a doubt, leads to triumph. You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.

Our greatest victory is not in never falling, but rising every time we fall. Emotional and physiological regulation, your thinking style, and your search for 
ultimate meaning and purpose in life makes up for your resilience.

Perseverance, adaptability, resilience, blah blah blah.....Boohoohoo! All of that is crap. What you need are real answers, not posh wordplay. Let me decode the pillars of success in crisp and simple words.

# How to Succeed in life, explained.
First of all, you might ask why I am qualified to talk about this. Do you think someone has to be successful in everything in life after they step out of the womb? As the old saying goes, you don't have to be a baker to tell if a cake tastes like shit.

Now shut up and listen up, you stupid lizard brain.

To succeed in anything, you need to nail down two things - External factors and internal factors. 

1. External Factors - There are things in life that come from within. This is not it. External factors are the ways that the evil world lays its influence on your life. You can definitely do things about it though.
	1. Food
	2. Sleep
	3. Affection
2. Internal Factors - These are the factors that come from within - about how your mind and soul is. These are not as directly impacted by the world because once you are in your late teens and adulthood, the degree of impact that anyone can have on your mind is really up to you. That complete sense of control over your mind is the biggest source of motivation for many things in life.
	1. Passion
	2. Vision
	3. Dedication

We humans are really simple beings. A lack of success in anything in your life can be explained to be caused by one of these factors. Self reflect and identify the issue and work towards fixing it. Anything can be accomplished in your life. Godspeed!

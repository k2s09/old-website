## Article Ideas
I have come up with several complex thoughts that I plan to write about in the future. Whenever I glance at any of these ideas, I can already envision subtextually exploring them in a 2-3 thousand word essay each. It's clear to me that each topic is rich in content, with so much depth and nuance that can be explored. Overall, I'm excited to develop these interesting ideas further and share them here.

- Information Absorption (roughly talked about this idea in my article on Typing)
- Breakthroughs in Renewable Energy
- Privacy and Security
- Pseudoscience
- Cloud Storage
- Cybersecurity
- My Choices in Gaming
- The Endgame: Happiness
- The Importance of Design and Typography
- Learnings in Web Development
- Sugary Cravings
- Religion and Spirituality

- The Sheer Efficiency of Modern Computers
- Pens - The Power of the Written Word
- Experiences being an Executive in Technology

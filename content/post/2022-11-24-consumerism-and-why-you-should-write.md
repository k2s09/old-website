### Gumption Trap

Noun.

A human-created situation that drains away initiative or original effort. From gumption (spunk; resourcefulness; sensible initiative) + trap (a trick or contrivance for catching and holding people or animals).

*Example*

Your constant objections are turning this meeting into a gumption trap.

Don't ask Linda to get involved with anything that has to get done right away; the woman is a walking gumption trap.

Early in my journey learning and applying various soft skills, building my character and embarking on projects, I realized that content creation is a must-have feather in one’s cap. The entire workflow in expressing your thoughts is conducive to growth. Hence, I wanted to become a writer, and here we are! I write opinion pieces and essays fairly regularly but don’t always publish them. 

So, reader! Consider channelising your voice and opinions, try writing!

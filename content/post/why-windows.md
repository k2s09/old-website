The grass isn’t greener on the other side. So, why do I use Windows after being a huge Linux user for over 3 years?

I am an experienced Linux user, and a fan of open-source. I’ve used everything from Debian, Arch, Fedora and their mainstream derivative distros, at times without Windows. I am enthusiastic about security and privacy. I occasionally read news of the latest developments in Wayland, DE’s and the Linux Kernel. With all that said, I’ve primarily been a Windows user for as long as I remember using computers, and will continue to be one primarily. Here is why:

## Windows isn’t bad

I have never felt like Windows was a buggy and messy OS. Sure, there are plenty of examples of that online, but I have not experienced such. Windows is annoying at times, yes, but not **that** buggy. Over time, I’ve mastered how to maintain a Windows installation perfectly and have always had a wonderful experience with the OS.

I’ve learned to identify malicious software, PUPs, and adware, can keep my installation clean and secure without the need for a third-party antivirus, and don’t face crashes with system apps. Big picture, you can fully utilise Microsoft’s vast array of well-made first-party apps and an even bigger platform of power-user apps.

Windows allows me to enjoy _using_ my PC. Linux is something I like fiddling with, but wouldn’t have time to do so in the future. In such a case, I would want to use my PC instead of tinkering with it in my spare time. Not to say that Linux can’t be stable and is only for tinkering, but there are more reasons.

## Installation and Setup

Objectively, I do not find Windows inferior in setting up. Let’s dissect my statement.

First let’s go over drivers. The _point_ of using Windows is preferring the proprietary software the drivers that it provides over all open source. Most things are automatically downloaded from Windows Update, but get your component drivers from your vendor, or individually from Intel, Nvidia, etc, and check for updates occasionally. It works. Now, on Linux, most people don’t have to think about drivers _at all._ That is absolutely amazing. There are not much grounds for comparison on this point unless you have some specific requirement.

When it comes to apps, essentially, they are equal. On Linux, I am a hardcore terminal user and do not shy away from it at all. I’ve installed Arch multiple times through the terminal and Arch Wiki. However, on Windows, installing apps is better than people like to believe, and how it is perceived online. The Windows Store, Winget Package Manager and it’s slew of GUI wrappers, and simply searching for apps on Google or Bing gives you access to an equal or greater set of apps, and they all _work reliably_. On Linux, although it is nice to open your terminal and install popular apps in one command, it is not always that simple, with version, availability, and permission issues.

The problem is needless redundancy. With disparities in distros, package managers, and packaging formats, one can easily run into version and availability issues. Having to package apps for an increasing list of distros is incredibly wasteful. The various app standards are repetitive and confusing for new users. I know to use shared system-wide dependencies for most things and Flatpak for certain apps, but not everyone is clear about it, and at times, I _do_ stumble upon tar.gz, Snaps and AppImages formats for apps that may be non-negotiable to me.  Users can just _not_ care about these issues, but that generally leads to another issue, “dependency hell”. So, it is not perfect system, and more about getting used to either workflow. It sounds ironic but I have gone full circle.

## The App Inequality

The inequality of apps present for either platform is huge. I think that Open-Source alternatives are not always the answer, and that **pure** libre distros and software is not a completely good idea. To be clear, I am not blaming anyone on the Linux side or making this their problem. It’s not, but still, there is a clear reason to prefer Windows — using the best tools for the job — Microsoft Office, Adobe Suite, countless other professional apps, and thousands of games. For those involved in _privateering_, all those guides, cracks, and activators exist for Windows. Giving it up and looking to alternative open-source programs doesn’t cut it for everyone. If I am going to be incredibly honest, this might the biggest reason.

I’d like to dive deeper into games. Gaming on Linux is better than ever, but not up to date. [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlg4K16ujFw) made a whole series on reviewing Linux, and they are a bunch of serious gamers. It matched my general opinion that while you can certainly game on Linux, there are some things you are missing out on – trying out the latest games as they come out (many times it takes longer for things to become smooth) and certain multiplayer games due to anti-cheat (even if you want to play single-player, just because it has multiplayer, it has anti-cheat) to name some. I suppose the GPU drivers are also putting off for some. They are not up to par with their Windows counterparts.

## Appearance

The UI of Windows 11 is simply incredible. The 2022 updates have smashed it out of the park. Paired with a decent machine, it works well and looks great. But I am proud to say that the Linux DE's have caught up. Gnome 4x and KDE 5.x are freaking amazing today. I am happy to say that they are comparable to Windows, so it is an individual preference.

## Knowledge and Culture

Using Windows, my tech knowledge, know-how, and troubleshooting skills are top-notch, for my own sake and for others. It is not about being the Tech Support person, although that does sometimes happen, and it’s alright, I am a natural problem solver. Being able to play the latest games with my friends without worrying about the installation and compatibility of the latest apps and features, I would like to keep it that way.

My expertise in technology goes beyond my knowledge and journey; I am proud to play an active part in the Tech Cohort of our times. With that said, I would say that I am a very advanced user and easily fit into any talks about Linux in the general Tech Community. Knowing the depths of your OS is always a nice CS lesson, for Windows and Linux alike. There is no lack of culture in the Linux community, it’s vast, grand and pretty fun to read on. So, it’s a tie here.

## Virtualisation and Dual Boot

Running Linux on Windows is much easier than the other way around. Microsoft has created an expansive ecosystem that runs Linux and Android software on Windows in a hassle-free way. WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is a mature project and is suitable for the development and testing of Linux. It provides the most seamless integration between the two operating systems. If I were to daily drive Linux, I would not be comfortable to use virtualized Windows for a handful of apps, at least with my current hardware. If I had a balling PC, things would could be different.

For quite some time, the problems, inconveniences, and disruptions regarding dual boot didn’t concern me much. Maybe, I just didn’t have much real work. Anyway, what is expected from the Tech workflow of regular high schoolers? _Now_, I would happily use one OS.

## Miscellaneous

My device is on an active warranty. I need Windows if I run into problems with the hardware.

I tried a lot of distros, and seemed to settle for the perfect – Fedora, but she broke my heart. The community accepted me with wide arms and a warm hug, but the distro didn’t. I have had tons of issues, [which I have outlined in detail in this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/vg06mf/the_crazy_story_of_fedora_and_its_kernel).

Alright, rapid-fire!! No widespread adoption of Secure Boot, not easy Nvidia driver support on non-Ubuntu based distros including the signing of kernel modules, Nouveau, systemd-boot, tons of kernel panics, the elitism around Linux and ricing being pointless and a colossal waste of time. Phew!

It doesn’t affect my conscience using Windows. I thought about it, and don't really care. It is good having opinionated software. Just my thoughts.

## The Conclusion

At the end of this article, there is an emotion that I would like to share. Whenever I see other takes on this matter, or some criticism being given to Linux, I dislike the use of the phrase “You guys should understand”. Not that every use of this phrase in this context is inappropriate, however, I do not like the approach that ‘the community is the guardian of the OS’, and I am unapologetic when I say this.

As a member of the Linux community, I do have a vested interest in seeing open-source projects grow and become better, but I am not personally dying for everyone to switch over to the Linux world, nor do I heavily criticize Microsoft or other corporations conspiring to make the lives of Linux users worse. The software is open source, for god’s sake, people working on these aren’t making money.

The Linux community does not need to ‘understand’ anything. As a user, you have the complete choice to not use, or bud in with the community, yet do whatever you want. I do not mean to hinder improvements by sounding egoistic, I hope people would continue to contribute towards this amazing community and group of software, out of passion and the collective good, but let’s keep it at that.

People are working paid jobs to work on security and Linux compatibility, but apart from that, let’s not put blame the experience of Linux distros lacking behind their competitors because of the people working behind them. I would just like to see people criticize Linux without going after the people behind the product, especially because it is free (in all aspects).

I believe I am not taking a side with the ones who don’t like Linux, nor am I leaning towards the philosophy of the radical and hardcore GNU+Linux user, I am taking a middle approach, caring for the people working on these projects. Whatever I end up doing, I want to be considerate towards you all.

I’ve spent a ton of my time on Linux and have made a realization.

It is understood that Linux is ‘there’ in terms of readiness for personal use. I have just realized that given my use case, I’d rather use Windows than stay on the other side for this purpose. Linux is touted to be better on servers and IoT devices, sure, I would happily and proficiently use Linux there. Linux is also meant to be great for development, which is true, but I have many great tools on Windows as well. I am quite curious about computer software and Linux is a fantastic bastion of learning, and I will always hang on to that.

So, because the underlying philosophy of Windows doesn’t bug me, and that I enjoy the benefits of staying on Windows, I use Windows 11 these days.
